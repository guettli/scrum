# Scrum: My point of view

My personal opinionated point of view about [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum).

Don't get me wrong: I like Scrum. Here are some things where I think different.

# Story points

> A: Will the old bridge hold us when we go over it?
>
> B: I am unsure. The bridge looks very old.
>
> A (fells fear): If we go over it and it ... collapses?
>
> B: Then it might be wise to not go over it, and instead we dance over it.
>
> A (relieved, happy): Great idea! If our heart is filled with joy we feel much lighter and then the bridge holds us. Good idea!
>
> B: ???

Most developers work 8 hours per day. But since some Scrum Gurus said you should use Story Points, most teams do it.

Please pay attention to the previous sentence. I wrote "Scrum Gurus", not "Scrum Guide". The official Scrum Guide only talks about "estimates".

Yes, I have read this [Jeff Sutherland "Story Points: Why are they better than hours?"](https://www.scruminc.com/story-points-why-are-they-better-than/).

I like challenges: As a developer, if I have a task which is estimated at 4 hours, this gives me a challenge: Solve it in three hours!

If I have a task that is measured in story points, then I don't have this personal challenge.

Now you could argue, I should find a magic function which maps from Story Points to hours. Then I have the same challenge. But wait: Why should I do this dancing forward and dancing backward? 

But maybe these fancy units have benefits. For examplel the "Jeff Bezos' 2 Pizza Rule". Why no use a boring range like "5 to 7 people"? Don't ask me. Somehow "2 Pizza Rule" is way better than a boring numbers. Maybe it is the same for "story points vs hours". Maybe selling ideas is more important than having great ideas.

# "Sprint Goal" vs "constant flow"

The Scrum Guide does not define "Sprint Goal", only the term [Sprint](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-sprint).

But "Sprint Goal" gets used several times.

Of course it depends. Maybe you have well defined Sprint Goals. But in my experience only 5% of Sprints have one well defined goal. This raises the question: "Is a sprint goal needed?". I can happily live without it. It is like a constant flow of issues: New features, old bugs, refactoring. 

Example: We start a new sprint and have capacity for 40 Story Points. We fill the sprint backlog with 15 issues. Now have a look at these 15 issues. Many of them are not related to another. They are issues. Some small, some big. There is no useful common denominator. Why create a Sprint Goal?

I think it makes sense to have 2 week sprints. But I don't need to give them a fancy name.

Just like version numbers like 20.04 make much more sense to me than [Focal Fossa (Ubuntu's fancy name for the current release)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/). I prefer the dry number which contains a date. In this case "April 2020".

If course there are goals which have names. But they are created by the product team and they usualy have long term plans.

Since the scrum team exists to do what the product team wants, it does not make sense that the scrum team invents a written "Sprint Goal" for each sprint. Quarterly goals by the product teams are enough.

# A sprint is a less than short-term

Maybe I am blind, but up to now I could not find information in the scrum guide about the long term planning.

Working in two week sprints is fine.

Nevertheless you need a bit more.

You should be aware of this.

For me, short-term means 3..6 months, mid-term means 6..12 months, long-term means 12.. months.

If you look at Scrum this way, a Sprint is less than "short-term".

# Velocity

The Scrum Guide does not use the term "Velocity". But this glossary does contain it: [Glossary of scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/Resources/Scrum-Glossary)

There are rumours that the velocity should get better and better and better until the scrum team flies with the speed of light (joking)

If the leaders want the velocity to increase, they will get what they want. The puzzle is easy to solve. Developers will just need to use higher estimates. Higher estimates, higher velocity.

I don't think that you can measure velocity. Evey development task is different. If leaders want high velocity, then developers won't do very important tasks like cleaning up code, writing tests, try new tools, ....

# Scrum is free - no money involved?

Scrum is free. We all love each other. No money is involved?

If I search for "scrum guide" I get this result:

![google search for "scrum guide"](scrum-guide--google-search2.png)

There is an advertisment.

This means scrum.org is paying google money to get to the top of this page.

So you should be aware of the fact that there is some marketing campaign behind scrum.

There are people who earn more money if more people use scrum.

Maybe Scrum is more successful than Kanban in the last years (see [Google Trend "Scrum Kanban"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=%2Fm%2F01mwhw,%2Fm%2F0ck_p8)) because Scrum has a better marketing campaign?

# The term "Sprint".

I like long-distance running. A half marathon (21km) are a great distance. Depending on the mood and entuisiasm this means one and a half or two hours of constant workout. I like it.

I am not a sprinter. I am too slow on short distances.

And now back to software development with Scrum: The interesting things won't get solved in one sprint.

I am not happy with the term "Sprint", but up to now I found no better alternative. Do you have one?
