# Scrum: My point of view

My personal opinionated point of view.

# Story points

> A: Will the old bridge hold us when we go over it?
>
> B: I am unsure. The bridge looks very old.
>
> A (fells fear): If we go over it and it ... collapses?
>
> B: Then it might be wise to not go over it, and instead we dance over it.
>
> A (relieved, happy): Great idea! If our heart is filled with joy we feel much lighter and then the bridge holds us. Good idea!
>
> B: ???

Most developers work 8 hours per day. But since some Scrum Gurus said you should use Story Points, most teams do it.

Yes, I have read this [Jeff Sutherland "Story Points: Why are they better than hours?"](https://www.scruminc.com/story-points-why-are-they-better-than/).

I like challenges: As a developer, if I have a task which is estimated at 4 hours, this gives me a challenge: Solve it in three hours!

If I have a task that is measured in story points, then I don't have this personal challenge.

Now you could argue, I should find a magic function which maps from Story Points to hours. Then I have the same challenge. But wait: Why should I do this dancing forward and dancing backward again?
