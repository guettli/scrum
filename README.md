# Scrum: My point of view

My personal opinionated point of view about [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum).

# Story points

> A: Will the old bridge hold us when we go over it?
>
> B: I am unsure. The bridge looks very old.
>
> A (fells fear): If we go over it and it ... collapses?
>
> B: Then it might be wise to not go over it, and instead we dance over it.
>
> A (relieved, happy): Great idea! If our heart is filled with joy we feel much lighter and then the bridge holds us. Good idea!
>
> B: ???

Most developers work 8 hours per day. But since some Scrum Gurus said you should use Story Points, most teams do it.

Yes, I have read this [Jeff Sutherland "Story Points: Why are they better than hours?"](https://www.scruminc.com/story-points-why-are-they-better-than/).

I like challenges: As a developer, if I have a task which is estimated at 4 hours, this gives me a challenge: Solve it in three hours!

If I have a task that is measured in story points, then I don't have this personal challenge.

Now you could argue, I should find a magic function which maps from Story Points to hours. Then I have the same challenge. But wait: Why should I do this dancing forward and dancing backward? 

But maybe these fancy units have benefits. For examplel the "Jeff Bezos' 2 Pizza Rule". Why no use a boring range like "5 to 7 people"? Don't ask me. Somehow "2 Pizza Rule" is way better than a boring numbers. Maybe it is the same for "story points vs hours". Maybe selling ideas is more important than having great ideas.

# "Sprint Goal" vs "constant flow"

The Scrum Guide does not define "Sprint Goal", only the term [Sprint](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-sprint).

But "Sprint Goal" gets used several times.

Of course it depends. Maybe you have well defined Sprint Goals. But in my experience only 5% of Sprints have one well defined goal. This raises the question: "Is a sprint goal needed?". I can happily live without it. It is like a constant flow of issues: New features, old bugs, refactoring. 

I think it makes sense to have 2 week sprints. But I don't need to give them a fancy name.

Just like version numbers like 20.04 make much more sense to me than [Focal Fossa (Ubuntu's fancy name for the current release)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/). I prefer the dry number which contains a date.

# Scrum is free - no money involved?

Scrum is free. We all love each other. No money is involved?

If I search for "scrum guide" I get this result:

![google search for "scrum guide"](scrum-guide--google-search2.png)

There is an advertisment.

This means scrum.org is paying google money to get to the top of this page.

So you should be aware of the fact that there is some marketing campaign behind scrum.

There are people who earn more money if more people use scrum.

Maybe Scrum is more successful than Kanban in the last years (see [Google Trend "Scrum Kanban"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=%2Fm%2F01mwhw,%2Fm%2F0ck_p8)) because Scrum has a better marketing campaign?
